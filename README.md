# Locality Sensitive Hashing for Tampering Dectection

Source code used for detecting tampering using the Exact Euclidean Locality Sensitive Hashing (E2LSH) method. Experimental results were conducted  on a dataset collected from the On-Board Diagnostics port (OBD) of a Kia SOUL vehicle demonstrate the practical applicability of the developed methodology.
